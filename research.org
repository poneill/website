* Research Summary

  Cells are chemical computers that accept environmental signals as
  inputs and express genes as outputs.  An even shorter way of putting
  this is just to say that /cells compute their metabolism/.  I'm
  interested in helping to understand this process through
  applications of statistical physics, information theory and machine
  learning to the study of transcriptional regulation in bacteria.

  I'm particularly interested in the relationships between the
  parameters that characterize transcription factors and their cognate
  binding sites.  Each regulatory system consists of a transcription
  factor, present at a given mean copy number, and a set of binding
  sites which must be bound with given target probabilities.  For a
  given functional specification there are often many "programs" which
  can encode roughly equivalent behaviors-- how does nature decide?
  From a collection of binding sites known to be co-regulated by a
  transcription factor, what can be inferred about the system
  requirements of the network it participates in and the evolutionary
  dynamics which produced it?  These questions lead us to develop
  mathematical and computational models of protein-DNA co-evolution in
  order to understand the design constraints that gave transcriptional
  regulatory networks their present wiring.
